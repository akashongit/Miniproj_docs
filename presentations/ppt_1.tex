		\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Employee Leave Management System}
		\\ This system is deployed in Rashtrasant Maharaj University,Nagpur.It allows manager to manage leaves and replacements for better scheduling	of workload.But the system will not function properly with multiple computers in the network.
		
		\item \textbf{Development of Employee Leave Database }
		\\ This system is developed to support the work of the Human Resource Department of Home Finance Company(HFC) Bank, Ghana.It is a web enabled project.But the size of database increases day by day hence increasing the load on database backup.
			
		\item \textbf{Human Resource E-Leave Management }
		\\It is a decision support system.There is leave rejection as well as leave acceptence,but it does not include solo parent leave and absence with pay.
		
		\end{itemize}

		\subsection{System Study Report} %system study			
		\begin{frame}{Report of Work Done}{System Study Report}
		There is no existing online leave management system in our college.The faculties of mec gets an opportunity to apply for leave online from anywhere.Granting or denying leave requests can be just a click away and the process would bring in transparency and adherence to college's leave policy.
