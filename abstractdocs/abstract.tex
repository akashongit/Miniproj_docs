This project is aimed at developing an online leave  management system that is of importance to either an organisation or a college . The Leave Management System (LMS) is an Intranet based application that can be accessed                          throughout the organisation or a specified group/Dept. This system can be used to automate the workflow of leave applications and their approvals. The periodic crediting of leave is also automated. There are features like email notifications, cancellation of leave, automatic approval of leave, report generators etc in this system.
